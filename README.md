introduction
------------
This is freebay. A place where you can get physical things as well as services for free. The site is based on so called "offers". A "offer" is a description of a physical good (e.g. home made soap) or service (e.g. ride in my car). Users can very easily cretate offers and browse for offers by using tags and specifying a desired location

strategy
--------
The current strategy for freebay is to make it userless. This means everyone has read and wire access to the database. In order to prevent threats such as bot powered bulk removal of the database, captchas could be introduced for all operations that affect the database. The benefit is that we create a platform that maintains its self. for example if Alice notices tha Bob is not responding to an offer he issued for a long period of time, Alice would then remove Bob's offer so that others will not waste their time with Bob's offer. This way the site will represent the vibe of the collective, possibly in a comparable way to a game such as minecraft.


vision
------
The vision of freebay is to promote resource sharing and supporting those in need.
